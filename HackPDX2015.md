## Ninja Scheduler

Premise: a calendar app that enables organizers to create and schedule for multiple groups and constraints (time blocks); empowers college students with a simple way to schedule group activities (e.g., team projects) without having to deal with multiple email, smartphone, desktop/laptop, or school-based email systems.
