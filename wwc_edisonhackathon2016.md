**IoT Hackathon 2016: Sustainable Cities**

Join us the weekend of Dec. 2nd-4th for our very first IoT Hackathon! 
The theme is Sustainable Cities; we are looking for ways to minimize 
the required inputs of energy, water and food. On a smaller scale, how 
can we preserve energy and prevent wasteful consumption in the home and/or 
at work? We are thrilled to be partnering up with Intel to bring you the 
Intel Edison hardware kits to play with and build cool apps.

Organized by Women Who Code Portland #WWCode
(https://www.womenwhocode.com/portland)
[Meetup] (https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/)

**Where:** 1615 Southeast 3rd Avenue #200, Portland, OR 97214
**When:** Fri, Dec 2, 2016 at 5:00 PM

Pre-Hackathon Event on Wednesday (12/30) at Simple from 5:30-7:30
Simple has a one story parking structure, and there’s street parking just off the Hawthorne bridge.

**Event hashtags:** #iothackpdx #IntelMaker

**About the hardware:**
The board's main SoC is a 22 nm Intel Atom "Tangier" (Z34XX) that includes two
Atom Silvermont cores running at 500 MHz and one Intel Quark core at 100 MHz 
(for executing RTOS ViperOS). The SoC has 1 GB RAM integrated on package. There 
is also 4 GB eMMC flash on board, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4 and USB controllers; meaning, 
we can write data to the 4 GB of flash
