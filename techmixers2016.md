I thought I would jot down some of the networking mixers that I know about in the greater Portland area.
I like to stick to downtown Portland or Vancouver for meetups; anywhere else is just inconvenient with
weekday traffic. Hackathons are not on this post. 

If you were looking for a more robust event listing site than [Calagator.org] (http://calagator.org) for tech meetups, 
there really isn't one. [Eventbrite] (http://www.eventbrite.com) and [Meetup.com] (http://www.meeetup.com.) are how I
found out about most of these.
