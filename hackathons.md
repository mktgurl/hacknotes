There are a few hackathons that are organized in the greater Portland area. The majority are devops and gamedev centric; meaning, if your particular discipline isn't in software programming, say instead you are focused on graphic design, marketing, finance, project management, human resources or office management, these might not be as easy to create a minimum viable product within the allotment of time.

Perhaps one of the many goals of why hackathons exist in Portland is to bring like minded people together to build something new from scratch. The hardest part is a viable idea that a team of 2-6 people can collaborate upon and present to a large group of strangers for mass public appeal.

For new organizers, there are two guides that I know of:  
[The Book of Hackathon] (http://guide.mlh.io)  
[The Hackathon Guide] (https://hackathon.guide/) by Joshua Tauberer  

Not a definitive list, but a starting point for 2016.
