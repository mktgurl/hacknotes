## ** Startup Weekend Vancouver **  

Have you ever wondered if your idea is worth turning into a business?

Startup Weekend is a 54-hour event that's designed to help you help you launch your idea. The weekend is all about getting the right people together who have ideas, or expertise or ability to help make it happen. 

You bring the ideas, skills, and talent and we bring the expertise and structure. It's an open structure that lets anyone pitch a business idea and build a team to help you make it a reality. It can be an application, a service, a food, or even a device or tool. Anything you can think of we've seen it and we can help.

Vancouver has become a growing, vibrant town turning into a city with great new opportunities. That means we need entrepreneurial and innovative people like you.
